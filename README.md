List of added file & quicknote on the file:
1. mjDFS.py 

quicknote: this is one of my favourite Python data structure and algorithm program. It is a Deep First Search algorithm implementation on famous "Number of Islands" graph problem (it is listed in Leetcode as well as this issue often asked in recruitment for big company like Amazon, Facebook, Google). I added simple function to print the graph to track the progress of DFS exploration so we can easily see how DFS "explore" the land.
